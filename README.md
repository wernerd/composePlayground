# A playground for Android's Jetpack Compose UI toolkit

As the name already states this is a playground where I implement and test some features of 
Jetpack Compose. This project is not meant as a production or a big example project, however
may serve to get some ideas how to use Jetpack Compose in specific cases, for example specific
layout requirements or UI element design requests.

This repository may also serve as a project to show issues, probably reported to the relevant
issue tracker.
