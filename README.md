# A playground for Android's JetPack Compose UI

As the name already states this is a playground where I implement and test some features of 
JetPack Compose. This project is not meant as a production project, however may serve to get
some ideas how to use JetPack Compose in some specific case, for example layout or design.

This repository may also serve as a project to show issues, probably reported to the relevant
issue tracker
